**Password Generator

This repo serves as a test bed for my first repo as well as my first java project

The password generator creates a password with the criteria from the user input,
password length, amount of special characters, and any desired words or phrases.

The password is then randomized.

Sample run

Create password?   y
Enter length of password:  6
Special Characters?   y
How many?  2
Special word?  y
Enter word?  fun

Password is *fnO&u


**Again this is my first attempt at both repo, and java program so any tips, comments, or ideas are all welcomed.

Stay classy SanDiego
